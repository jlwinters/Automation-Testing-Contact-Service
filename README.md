## Reflection

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
* How do I approach designing software?

As a software engineer, it is my responsibility to ensure that my code meets several criteria. My software must be functional, secure, and meet the users' needs. Ensuring code functionality and security is crucial to any project, and I continue to practice new ways to improve these areas in my code. During my work on this project, I utilized JUnit tests to run my code against predetermined input as part of a use-case scenario, which will help me verify that I meet the product requirements, and that the code runs as expected. I performed several manual code review processes to further solidify the code structure and make sure that it is free of errors. Finally, I can ensure that my code is secure by practicing secure coding techniques and secure error handling. User needs can be determined by creating user test cases, but in cases where this isn't possible, it is helpful to refer to the product requirements and develop test cases that verify proper functionality.  My approach to designing software begins and ends with the user requirements. Essentially, my code should do what the user expects it to do, whilst maintaining a proper level of security and avoiding errors.
